This meeting was recorded, recording is [here](https://us02web.zoom.us/rec/share/OWpQlTnI5holkpHZQIs7wIpEeevsbEkHrL-pBB1wbB7jp8vG0zfL5mF_qUYsZbFC._GbmquC9jQz5AsKi)

* Are suspenders necessary?

  This discussion was tabled until the next discussion.

* Should wrapped imports resolve their inputs?

  After discussing the special scenario involving Atomics.awaitAsync, it was decided that we should follow the TAG guidelines and enforce inputs of wrapped imports to be Promises (with the net effect that invoking a wrapped import will always result in suspending the application).

* How to implement feature detection?

  If the Suspender object is not available, then this can be done using WebAssembly.function with a 'suspending' option (this results in an exception if JSPI is not available).
